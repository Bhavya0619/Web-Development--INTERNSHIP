🌐 Web Development Projects (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate web development projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of these projects is to strengthen core front-end concepts and demonstrate practical implementation of responsive design, styling, and dynamic behavior.

Each project focuses on different aspects of web development such as page structure with HTML, layout and responsiveness using CSS (Flexbox & Grid), and interactivity using JavaScript. Features include form validation, dynamic content updates, event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic client-side logic.

These projects are designed with clean and readable code to help learners understand how individual components work together to create functional web applications. The layouts are optimized for different screen sizes to ensure a smooth user experience across devices.

This repository is ideal for students, beginners, and anyone looking to revise or practice front-end development fundamentals. You are welcome to explore the code, use it for learning purposes, and modify it to build your own projects.
